# BMTH Website

A project I had to make for school.
A website about _Bring Me The Horizon_ made using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and a little bit of [Koa.js](http://koajs.com/) to serve the built files.

---

The website is published using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
You can see the final result by going to [bmth-website.herokuapp.com](http://bmth-website.herokuapp.com/#/) or by cloning this repo and running ```npm start```
